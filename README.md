k-means Image Color Quantization
================================

*k-means Image Color Quantization* is a webpage that can apply color
quantization to images using k-means clustering.

The code runs fully in the browser. That is, there are no server-side calls
to process the image and/or run the clustering and quantization. The
implementation is in JavaScript.

How To Use
----------

To quantize an image, navigate to index.html, load an image, select a value for
*k*, and click *Quantize*. The time to process increases with the size of the
image.
